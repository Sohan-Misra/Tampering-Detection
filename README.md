# Tampering-Detection

This project is used to detect Copy Move and Splicing Tampering in images using Transfer learning and Error level analysis.

## Goal:
To better understand the working of python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and to use machine learning frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras to implement solution to rreal life problems.

## Technologies used:
* Python
* Numpy 
* Pandas
* Matplolib
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Google Colab

## Notes:
* The COpyMove.ipynb and Splicing.ipynb are the notebooks where copy move and splicing tampering are detected.
* Create dataset.ipynb notebook creates labels for MICCF-2000 dataset for Copy Move forgery.
* Create_Casia_Dataset.ipynb notebook creates labels for CASIA dataset.
* First run the notebooks to generate labels then run the individual notebooks for tampering dtection.

## Data Source:
* Casia: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divg07/casia-20-image-tampering-detection-dataset
* MICCF-2000: http://lci.micc.unifi.it/labd/cmfd/MICC-F2000.zip
